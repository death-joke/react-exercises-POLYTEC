# Exercice put a context in your app :

1. Create a context to hold your object returned by your hooks
1. Provide the context to your Todo component
1. Get the data from your hooks in Create and List Component, without using props

NOTE : using a context for 2 children component is not a good idea, it's better to use props in this case. BT we are
here to practice context, and understand thelimit of using it.
